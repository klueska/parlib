The Parlib library was originally written for the Akaros operating system.  For
this reason, this port was originally designed as an emulation layer on top of
Linux that would allow developers to write applications and test them on a
linux system before deplying them on Akaros.

Since its original inception, however, we've discovered that Parlib is useful
in its own right as a standalone library on linux for use by other projects.
Most notably, as the backend for the Lithe implementation.

At present, Parlib provides 3 primary services to developers:
1) A virtual core (vcore) abstraction
2) A user-level thread (uthread) abstraction
3) User-space Mcs and Spin Locks
