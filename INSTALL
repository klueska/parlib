Installation instructions

To install this library, simply follow the standard GNU installation procedure.

If building out of the git source repo, you will need to rerun autoconf and
automake.  You can do these two steps together, by just running autoreconf.
You therefore need to have the autotools installed on your system.
The installation procedure would be:

autoreconf --install
mkdir build
cd build
../configure --prefix=<install_dir>
make
make install

To clean up all generated files and get back to only files tracked by the git
repo, you can simply run:

git clean -x -d -f

If building out of the tarball distribution, you can skip the autoreconf step
entirely, as the files it generates are already provided to you (you can still
do it if you like though).

mkdir build
cd build
../configure --prefix=<install_dir>
make
make install

Don't forget to use 'sudo' if you are installing into a directory which
requires root priveleges.
